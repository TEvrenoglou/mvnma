\title{Rank treatments across all outcomes using the VIKOR multi-criteria decision
analysis method.}
\usage{
vikor(x, ...)

\method{vikor}{mvrank}(x, weights = NULL, v = 0.5, ...)

\method{vikor}{matrix}(x, weights = NULL, v = 0.5, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{\link{mvrank}} or a matrix.}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguments.}

\item{weights}{Outcome weights. The weights should always sum to 1. If not
then they are standardized. If NULL, the function will assume equal outcome
weights.}

\item{v}{A scalar from 0 to 1 interpreted as the weight of the decision
making process. Following guidance from the multi-criteria decision
analysis field it is set to 0.5.}
}
\value{
The function returns a 'vikor' object. This consists of three ranking lists
which are the following:
\itemize{
\item A ranking list Q referring to the ranking when balancing both each
  treatment's overall and worst performance. This is the main ranking list
  of the method. 
\item A ranking list S referring to the ranking in terms of each treatment's
  overall performance.
\item A ranking list R referring to the ranking in terms of penalizing each
  treatment's worst performance.
}
In addition to the ranking lists, the function also evaluates the necessary conditions
defined by the VIKOR method and returns a message indicating the set of compromise
solutions.
}
\description{
This function employs the VIKOR method to analyze all outcome-specific
ranking lists. It provides both an amalgamated ranking list and guidance on
which treatments correspond to the best compromise solutions.
}
\details{
This function takes a single mandatory argument, which is either an object of class
\code{\link{mvrank}} or a matrix. It then uses the multi-criteria decision
analysis method VIKOR to produce an amalgamated ranking list across all
outcomes. The standard VIKOR approach is applied when the \code{method} argument
is set to \code{"sucra"} or \code{"pBV"} in \code{\link{mvrank}}. A fuzzy
VIKOR method is applied when outcome-specific rankings are expressed in terms of
median ranks and 95% credible intervals. The latter is possible when the
\code{\link{mvrank}} object is created with \code{method = "ranks"}.
In both cases, the final ranking list is calculated based on treatments
common across all outcomes. Treatments not present across all outcomes are
excluded internally.

Using the argument 'weights' the users can specify the weight that each
outcome should have in the decision making process. For each outcome this
argument should have a value from 0 to 1 while the sum of all outcome
weights should be 1. If the sum of all weights is not 1, then these are
internally standardize to achieve this. The standardized weight values
are returned as a message to the user. Finally, if NULL then equal weights
are assumed across all outcomes.

The argument 'v' specifies the weight of the decision making process.
The VIKOR method is a compromise programming approach that aims to balance
between each treatments overall and worst performance across all outcomes.
The balance between these two criteria is achieved using the parameter 'v'
which takes values from 0 to 1. Values close to 1 will give more weight to
the treatment's overall performance while values close to 0 will give more
weight to penalize the treatment's worst performance. The most common
choice of 'v' is typically 0.5 (default also here), thereby allowing for a
balanced decision making between treatment's overall and worst performance.
