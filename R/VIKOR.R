#' Rank treatments across all outcomes using the VIKOR multi-criteria decision
#' analysis method.
#' 
#' @description
#' This function employs the VIKOR method to analyze all outcome-specific
#' ranking lists. It provides both an amalgamated ranking list and guidance on
#' which treatments correspond to the best compromise solutions.
#' 
#' @param x An object of class \code{\link{mvrank}} or a matrix.
#' @param weights Outcome weights. The weights should always sum to 1. If not
#'   then they are standardized. If NULL, the function will assume equal outcome
#'   weights. 
#' @param v A scalar from 0 to 1 interpreted as the weight of the decision
#'   making process. Following guidance from the multi-criteria decision
#'   analysis field it is set to 0.5.
#' @param \dots Additional arguments.
#'
#' @details
#' This function takes a single mandatory argument, which is either an object of class
#' \code{\link{mvrank}} or a matrix. It then uses the multi-criteria decision
#' analysis method VIKOR to produce an amalgamated ranking list across all
#' outcomes. The standard VIKOR approach is applied when the \code{method} argument
#' is set to \code{"sucra"} or \code{"pBV"} in \code{\link{mvrank}}. A fuzzy
#' VIKOR method is applied when outcome-specific rankings are expressed in terms of
#' median ranks and 95% credible intervals. The latter is possible when the
#' \code{\link{mvrank}} object is created with \code{method = "ranks"}.
#' In both cases, the final ranking list is calculated based on treatments
#' common across all outcomes. Treatments not present across all outcomes are
#' excluded internally.
#' 
#' Using the argument 'weights' the users can specify the weight that each
#' outcome should have in the decision making process. For each outcome this
#' argument should have a value from 0 to 1 while the sum of all outcome
#' weights should be 1. If the sum of all weights is not 1, then these are
#' internally standardize to achieve this. The standardized weight values
#' are returned as a message to the user. Finally, if NULL then equal weights
#' are assumed across all outcomes.
#'
#' The argument 'v' specifies the weight of the decision making process.
#' The VIKOR method is a compromise programming approach that aims to balance
#' between each treatments overall and worst performance across all outcomes.
#' The balance between these two criteria is achieved using the parameter 'v'
#' which takes values from 0 to 1. Values close to 1 will give more weight to
#' the treatment's overall performance while values close to 0 will give more
#' weight to penalize the treatment's worst performance. The most common
#' choice of 'v' is typically 0.5 (default also here), thereby allowing for a
#' balanced decision making between treatment's overall and worst performance.
#' 
#' @return
#' The function returns a 'vikor' object. This consists of three ranking lists
#' which are the following:
#' \itemize{
#' \item A ranking list Q referring to the ranking when balancing both each
#'   treatment's overall and worst performance. This is the main ranking list
#'   of the method. 
#' \item A ranking list S referring to the ranking in terms of each treatment's
#'   overall performance.
#' \item A ranking list R referring to the ranking in terms of penalizing each
#'   treatment's worst performance.
#' }
#' In addition to the ranking lists, the function also evaluates the necessary conditions
#' defined by the VIKOR method and returns a message indicating the set of compromise
#' solutions.
